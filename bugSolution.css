Several solutions exist to center a div horizontally, even if its content overflows:

**1. Using Flexbox:**

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 50%;
}
```

This is generally the preferred and most robust solution.

**2. Using Grid Layout:**

```css
div {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  width: 50%;
}
```

Grid layout offers similar centering capabilities.

**3. Using `text-align: center;` (for inline elements):**

If the div is an inline element or contains only inline elements, you can center its content using:

```css
div {
  text-align: center;
}
```

Remember to choose the method that best suits your layout and overall design.
