The following CSS rule causes unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: 50%;
}
```

This code intends to center a div horizontally. However, if the div's content overflows its width (meaning the content is wider than 50%), the `margin: 0 auto;` will not work as expected.  The div might not center correctly. This is due to how `margin: 0 auto` works: it requires the element to have a defined width.
